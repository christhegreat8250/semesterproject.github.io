As the Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and the dictator of Nazi Germany, he played a pivotal role in the events leading up to World War II and the Holocaust. Hitler was a charismatic orator, utilizing propaganda to promote a virulent form of nationalism and anti-Semitism. His policies led to the invasion of Poland in 1939, triggering the start of World War II. Responsible for the genocide of six million Jews and millions of others during the Holocaust, Hitler's legacy is marked by the atrocities committed under his regime and the devastation caused by his aggressive expansionist policies.</p>
